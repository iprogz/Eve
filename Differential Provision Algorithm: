For each decision in Eve's decision-making process:
   if the input signal is positive:
      increase the decision weight by the individual's personal trait parameter
   else if the input signal is negative:
      decrease the decision weight by the individual's personal trait parameter
   else:
      leave the decision weight unchanged
