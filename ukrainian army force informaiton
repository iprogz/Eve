Thermal imaging sensor: The CITV's thermal imaging sensor detects the heat signatures of objects in the tank's surroundings and generates an image of the scene.

Optical sight: The CITV is typically equipped with an optical sight that allows the tank commander to observe and engage targets. The sight may be stabilized to compensate for the movement of the tank.

Laser rangefinder: Some CITVs are equipped with a laser rangefinder that can determine the range to a target by bouncing a laser beam off of it and measuring the time it takes for the beam to return.

Video display: The CITV's video display presents the image generated by the thermal imaging sensor and/or the optical sight to the tank commander.

Controls: The CITV is typically equipped with controls that allow the tank commander to adjust the system's settings and zoom in on targets.

Power supply: The CITV requires a power supply to operate, typically provided by the tank's electrical system.
