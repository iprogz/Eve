User Interface Design:

Create a graphical user interface (GUI) for the application using a suitable framework such as Tkinter or PyQt.
Design the layout and components of the GUI, including labels, buttons, text areas, and dropdowns, to display system information and interact with the user.
Application Logic:

Implement the logic to read the software and hardware information from the provided files.
Extract and process the relevant information from the files, such as kernel version, CPU model, CPU cores, and disk information.
Organize the processed information in appropriate data structures for easy retrieval and display.
Event Handling:

Implement event handlers for user interactions, such as clicking buttons or changing dropdown selections.
Define functions to handle events, such as updating system information or changing the logging level.
Connect the event handlers to the corresponding GUI components.
Logging:

Set up a logging mechanism to track the application's activities and record important events.
Configure the log level and format to capture the desired information.
Log relevant events, such as the application start and end, or any errors or warnings encountered during execution.
Packaging and Deployment:

Package the application into a distributable format, such as an executable or installer, depending on the target platform.
Ensure that all the necessary dependencies and resources are included in the package.
Create appropriate documentation, including installation instructions and user guides, to help users understand and use the application effectively.
Testing and Quality Assurance:

Develop a comprehensive testing strategy to verify the correctness and robustness of the application.
Write unit tests for the different components and functionalities of the application.
Conduct integration tests to ensure the seamless interaction between the GUI, event handling, and application logic.
Perform user acceptance testing to validate the user experience and gather feedback for further improvements.
Security and Privacy Considerations:

Implement security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.
Encrypt sensitive information, such as log files or user configurations, if required.
Comply with privacy regulations and respect user privacy by handling data appropriately.
Error Handling and Exception Management:

Implement error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle exceptions and prevent application crashes.
Display informative error messages to guide users in troubleshooting and reporting issues.
Log any errors or exceptions encountered during the application's execution for debugging purposes.
Continuous Improvement and Maintenance:

Regularly update and maintain the application to incorporate new features, bug fixes, and security patches.
Gather user feedback and monitor user experiences to identify areas of improvement.
Keep track of new developments in the underlying technologies and frameworks used by the application and update them as necessary.
